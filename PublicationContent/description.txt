[h1]Description[/h1]
Server-side mutator that makes bosses truly random.

[h1]What does it mean?[/h1]
Some players use the command to predict the boss. Here's the command:
[code]getall kfgamereplicationinfo bossindex[/code]
Copy this command, open the console (~), paste the command and press Enter.
In response, you will receive a string, the last number of which is the boss index:
[code]
0 = Hans Volter
1 = Patriarch
2 = King Fleshpound
3 = Abomination
4 = Matriarch
[/code]
This is possible because the boss is chosen at the beginning of the game.

[b]This mutator sets a random boss index right before the start of the boss wave and thus makes the command above completely useless.[/b]

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP gained will not be saved.

[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2;
[*]Open console (~) and input:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=TRB.TRBMut[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need)
[*]<Enter>.
[/olist]

[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
‚ùóÔ∏è If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ‚ùóÔ∏è
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=3047331564[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=TRB.TRBMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Important setup information[/h1]
The config should be created on first start, but now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ‚Äã‚Äãrandomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ‚Äã‚Äãor not be created at all.
So if you are using this mutator for the first time, I highly recommend doing the following:
[olist]
[*]Create (modify) [b]KFTRB.ini[/b] manually. Put the following content there:
[b][TRB.TRB]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Start the game/server with TRB to generate the contents of the config.
[*]Close the game/server.
[/olist]
[b]Right now this is the only way to correctly create the default config.[/b]
Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFTRB.ini)[/h1]
Honestly, you don't need to edit anything in the config, [b]just make sure you create the default config correctly[/b].
The config exists because I needed it during development ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[h1]Notes[/h1]
üìå Even if you use this mod, the boss prediction command can sometimes give correct predictions, just by chance. And that's okay. After all, this is a real random :)
