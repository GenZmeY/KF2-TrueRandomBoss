[h1]📋 Description[/h1]
Server-side mutator that makes bosses truly random.

[h1]🤔 What does it mean?[/h1]
Some players use the command to predict the boss. Here's the command:
[code]getall kfgamereplicationinfo bossindex[/code]
Copy this command, open the console (~), paste the command and press Enter.
In response, you will receive a string, the last number of which is the boss index:
[code]
0 = Hans Volter
1 = Patriarch
2 = King Fleshpound
3 = Abomination
4 = Matriarch
[/code]
This is possible because the boss is chosen at the beginning of the game.

[b]This mutator sets a random boss index right before the start of the boss wave and thus makes the command above completely useless.[/b]

[h1]❌ Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP gained will not be saved.

[h1]📌 Notes[/h1]
[list]
[*]Even if you use this mod, the boss prediction command can sometimes give correct predictions, just by chance. And that's okay. After all, this is a real random 🙃

[h1]☑️ Status: Completed[/h1]
✔️ The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
⛔️ Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
